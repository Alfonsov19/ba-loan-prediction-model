# SBA 504 Loan Approval Analysis

## Project Summary
This project investigates the patterns behind funded and unfunded SBA 504 commercial real estate loans, using a public dataset. It includes extensive EDA, feature engineering, and predictive modeling using Linear, Polynomial, and Ridge Regression.

 Business Problem
**How can we predict the gross amount approved for a commercial real estate loan based on business characteristics, job creation, and collateral?**

Financial institutions often struggle to proactively assess approval trends, gauge funding risks, and identify businesses likely to require alternative or follow-up financing. This project aims to support smarter lending strategies and partnership targeting (e.g., brokers, CRE agents).

## Key Results
- Final model (Polynomial Regression, degree=2) achieved:
  - R²: 0.98
  - Cross-validated R²: 0.966
- Engineered features: Business age category, loan density, approval per job, NAICS sector encoding
- Developed with: Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib

## Why It Matters
This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Understand and clean complex financial data
- Engineer predictive features from real-world business variables
- Communicate findings clearly and apply modeling to support loan and investment decisions
